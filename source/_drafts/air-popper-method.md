By far and away, the most common pocorn machine used to roast coffee is an air popper. 

## Preparation

### Things you will need

- __Air Popper__. Not all air poppers will work. Complete our [Checklist: Will your air popper roast coffee?](/).
- __About 70 grams (2.5 ounces) of unroasted coffee beans__. Can vary on machine. [Guide: How much coffee will your air popper roast?](/).
- __Large Spoon__. Needs to be heat safe, and non-conductive.
- __Large bowl__. To catch chaff, and keep the mess to a minimum.
- __2 Mesh strainers__. For cooling roasted beans. Metal collanders or bowls will work, but they're not ideal. 
- __Gloves__. An oven mitt will also work.

### Location setup

The roasting process can be a messy one. With plenty of smoke and [coffee chaff](/blog/what-is-coffee-chaff), ventilation is important. Under an oven ventilation hood can work great, and is a fine option. An even better option might be to find an open area, like a garage or outside - this can make cleanup much easier!

A stable work surface is prefered when roasting coffee. The last thing you need is to be chasing small, hot coffee beans all of the place after you tried to stir them.

One last thing to consider is lighting. Knowning the roast level can be tricky, especially when you are new to roasting coffee. Proper lighting can help you determine how dark the beans are getting throughout the roasting process.  

## Directions

1. Put the unroasted beans in the popcorn chamber.
2. Place the lid, including the butter tray, on the air popper. This will help direct the chaff down into your bowl, which should be located directly in front of the machine.
3. Turn on the air popper. During the first moments of the roast, the beans are still heavy and slow to turn; stiring them can help even out the roast. To stir the beans, remove the butter tray and used the handle of the spoon. (The side of the spoon normally used for stiring is often to large to actually stir the beans effectively.)
4. After a few minutes, the beans should reach "[First Crack](/)". At this stage, start to monitor them closely. Depending on the desired roast level, you may have to remove the beans any time now.
