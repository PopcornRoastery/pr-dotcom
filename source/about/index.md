Welcome to DIYRoasters.com! I’m so glad that you are here. Let me tell you a little bit about the website.

I you were to guess that I love the taste, smell, and fine details of coffee to the point of a near obsession, well, you would be right! I absolutely love discovering the differences between a great cup of coffee, and well, a not-so-great one. But the reason I’ve started DIY Roasters is because of the relationships built while drinking a cup of coffee make it so much more than just a cup!

It may sound absurd to think of coffee as something more than what it appears to be - a single drink, but it’s true! Just look around you. Coffee is everywhere. If you want to connect with someone quickly, the best way to do that is through commonalities; what’s more common than coffee? Coffee plus time could be the equation you need to connect with another human being! Is that a stretch? Maybe, but it’s at least a great conversation starter.

So you “just wanted to find out what this coffee website is about, and are wondering how you accidentally click on an ‘How-To Connect with Others’ article”? Hang in there. 

Since coffee could potentially be a great way to build relationships, wouldn’t it be great to know a little more about it? A conversation topic is great, but what about providing those you’re meeting with the best coffee you can, just to show you care? While the importance of coffee does seem to be slightly exaggerated here, I wouldn’t put either of these out of the realm of reality; I’ve used roasting my own coffee with a popcorn machine to do both! 

This is where Popcorn Roaster comes in: we help your average coffee drinkers learn to roast their own coffee beans with simple, cheap popcorn machines, so they can pour both coffee and care into the people around them.

## DIYRoasters.com is there to help you turn a popcorn machine into a little coffee roaster.

Hear me out. If you’re visiting DIYRoasters.com, coffee is more than likely something you drink everyday. It’s probably your go-to at every small get together or dinner party you host. It’s probably just-as-much a part of your bedtime routine as brushing your teeth! No? Just me? Okay then… I’m sure, at the least, coffee is something you really enjoy. Why not take advantage of the “Now, where did I put that thing, again?” popcorn machine, by turning it into the perfect coffee roaster? DIYRoasters.com is here to help you do exactly that!

If you have looked into roasting your own coffee beans before, then you most likely found that a coffee roaster can be expensive, and has a steep learning curve. Roasting coffee with a popcorn machine is quite the opposite!

Roasting your own coffee has several advantages over buying pre-roasted coffee beans. A good cup of coffee can be created via a many different factors: the coffee beans origin, roast level, brewing method, etc. DIY Roasters will do our best to help you understand these things as you learn what YOU want a cup of coffee to taste like.
