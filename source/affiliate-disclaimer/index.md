title: Affiliate Disclaimer

description: Popcorn Roastery would like to be transparent, so this affiliate disclaimer outlines how we handle commissions from products.
---

Iâ€™ve always believed in full disclosure and transparency when it comes to my sites. Given this, I want you to know that there may occasionally be products or services offered on PopcornRoastery.com from which I receive a commission if you make a purchase. I will indicate this is the case in the area where the product or service is mentioned. Advertising may also be sold on the site, but I will not receive commissions for any sales through those marketing pieces.

Fjellman Management, LLC dba PopcornRoastery.com is also a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com.
Please note that I have not been given any free products, services or anything else by these companies in exchange for mentioning them on the site.

If you have any questions regarding the above, please do not hesitate to contact me by using the contact page. It can be accessed on the menu above.
