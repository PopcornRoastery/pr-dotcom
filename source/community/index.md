Online communities are formed for any number of reasons. At DIYRoasters.com, we've tried to build a community that loves to build relationships, is kean to learn, and is open to sharing information with others. While it's great to make better coffee, it would all be for naught if you couldn't share the experience with others!

But what do you get out of joining the community, right? 

Here are three reasons you'll want to join:

- __Free stuff.__ You'll get instant access to free resources.
- __Content that YOU want.__ Over time, we learn what you want, so that's what we deliver.
- __Results.__ As our coffee gets better, we'll let you know.
