It doesn't take a lot to get started roasting your own coffee with popcorn machine. All you need is a popcorn machine, green coffee beans, and...

This _and_ stops some people from roasting their own coffee even before they start. It's my goal to prevent this from happening.  

## What equipment will you need to roast coffee?

Even before I give you a list of equipment, I want to make something clear: you don't _need_ anything else to roast coffee. If you only have a popcorn machine and unroasted coffee beans, your ready to go. However, in my opinion, it can be really helpful to have a few extra things to make your roasting experience a good one.

_Please remember that you will be working with high temperatures. Some of the equipment listed below will be in contact with the coffee or popcorn machine while temperatures are high. Use materials that work well at these temperatures._

### The Essentials

- __Gloves__. The roasting process can be hot! Getting burned is no fun.
- __Colander__. Cooling coffee quickly is crucial to a good roast. 
- __Small Scale__. Allows you to make repeatable, predictable results.
- __Stir Stick__. Stirring coffee helps keep the roast even.

### The Nice-To-Have's

- __Bean Storage__. For both unroasted and roasted beans.
- __Infrared Thermometer__. Popcorn machines can get _too_ hot: it's nice to know when they are.
- __Mesh Strainers__. Moving hot coffee from strainer to strainer is excellent for cooling!

### The Okay-This-Is-Too-Much-Fun's

- __Cooling Fan System__. Minimize the cooling time for consistent roasts.
- __Custom Modifications__. Any number of DIY components to ease your coffee roasting experience.
- __Roast Tracker__. Quality control yourself to the perfect roast.

## Equipment is the cream and sugar of coffee roasting

Again, all you really need to roast your own coffee with popcorn machine is the machine itself and unroasted coffee. But the right tools can be the difference between having a bitter experience and a delightful one.
