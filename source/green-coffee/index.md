## What is the purpose of buying green coffee?

What is green coffee? Green coffee beans are, simply put, coffee beans that have not yet been roasted.

If you're going to put in extra time, energy, and effort into making a better cup of coffee, then that cup needs to be better than your average joe. It's as simple as that. There's no point in roasting your own coffee, when you could buy coffee that's already roasted, if it's not better than pre-roasted coffee.

So, besides not being roasted yet, what are the differences between green coffee and the coffee you usually pick up at the local supermarket? Ultimately, recognizing them will help us understand "What is the purpose of buying green coffee?". When I've asked myself these questions, the answers have simply been:

- Personal flavor
- Cost per quality
- No expiration date

Let me briefly explain each of these points.

### Green coffee has a personal flavor

Coffee can have a personal flavor? If you're thinking like I was a while ago, then you'll be somewhere along the lines of, "Oh, you mean how I like my coffee flavored 'black', my dad likes the 'one SweetN' Low, one sugar, and one cream' flavor, and my friend likes his personal flavor: '80% creamer'". No, that's not what I mean at all!

The flavor of coffee beans can vary drastically! Things like type of coffee tree (Yes, coffee comes from a tree! Crazy right?), where the tree is located, or how the bean is removed from it's fruity exterior can all affected the final flavor of the bean.

I don't know about you, but finding out that coffee beans have different flavors instantly made me want to discover MY coffee flavor. What kind of coffee did I like best?

Now, I'm sure coffee in the local supermarket has different flavors too, but the choices there will be minimal. The variety found while shopping for green coffee has few rivals, and that's before you decide the level at which to roast the beans!

While reading about the vast flavor availability of green coffee, some of you may have immediately wanted to point out specialty coffees! Isn't the number choices found there enough for the average coffee consumer? Absolutely, but that's where our second point comes in.

### If you want quality beans, Green Coffee is cheap

At first glance, the case of _Coffee Quality vs Your Wallet_ seems open and shut: if you want better coffee, then you'll have to pay more. But let me tell you, this isn't the whole story. <!-- If you want our complete cost comparison, then you'll have to read our post [Graph: Coffee Quality vs Cost](/blog/graph-coffee-quality-vs-cost).-->

The balance of coffee quality and cost can be a tricky one. It's completely possibly, nay probable, that when you go to the store, you'll be able to find pre-roasted coffee beans that are cheaper than green coffee beans. This coffee is "fine", right? 

It's when you try to buy "good", that you'll see the cost savings of green coffee.

While you probably won't be buying as much coffee as a roastery (I guess you could be... but, wow!), you can still money by purchasing green coffee in larger quantities. This is something you could not do with roasted coffee, unless you are able to use it quickly.

### Green coffee doesn't expire (within reason)

Wasted coffee can be such a... waste! Have you ever wasted coffee before? It can be so frustrating to find that your coffee beans have gone stale. You either have to choke down what's left, or basically watch as you throw hard earned money in the trash.

I'll admit, at the rate I drink coffee, I haven't had this problem often. However, since I drink so much coffee, I was constantly having to go to the store for more, and that's always at the worst time possible. I like to keep those trips to a minimum, and buying in bulk helps me with that. 

Green coffee can be purchased in large quantities, without the immediate threat of going bad. I've personally had green coffee on my shelf for over a year, and not seen a significant drop in quality.

Let's not get carried away, please! This isn't to say that there's no real expiration date on green coffee. I am saying that I've not really had the chance to test this as a home coffee roaster. Even if I buy a large quantity of beans, I've always used them well within their shelf life.
