## What is the purpose of buying green coffee?

What is green coffee? Green coffee beans are, simply put, coffee beans that have not yet been roasted.

If you're going to put in extra time, energy, and effort into making a better cup of coffee, then that cup needs to be better than your average joe. It's as simple as that. There's no point in roasting your own coffee, when you could buy coffee that's already roasted, if it's not better than preroasted coffee.

So, besides not being roasted yet, what are the differences between green coffee and the coffee you usually pick up at the local supermaket? Ultimately, reconizing them will help us understand "What is the purpose of buying green coffee?". When I've asked myself these questions, the answers have simply been:

- Personal flavor
- Cost per quality
- No expiration date

Let me briefly explain each of these points.
