To roast your own coffee, you need two things: green, unroasted coffee and a coffee roaster. With a list that short, it's no wonder more and more people are wanting to roast coffee at home. There's a caveat though, and it's not the price of green coffee. Coffee roasters are expensive! Out of the need, home roasters have found an alternative: use popcorn machines to roast the beans.

__Popcorn machines are a common, easy to use, and cheap alternative to coffee roasting machines.__

On this page, I'll share what I've learned about using popcorn machines as coffee roasters!

## Why are popcorn machines a coffee roaster alternative?

Coffee machines can be _very_ specialized: from chaff holders and cooling fans, or from temperature probes and automated data graphs. These things can be very helpful when roasting coffee, but they are not necessary.

So, what are the _must have_ features of every coffee roaster? Every machine able to roast coffee must: 

- __Be Food Safe__. Coffee must be safe to consume after it has been roasted.
- __Have High Heat__. Upwards of 400°F (~200°C) should get the roasting started.
- __Rotation OR Have Air Flow__. All the beans need to feel that heat.

Popcorn machines can be used as coffee roasters because they share these features.

## What does "Popcorn Machine" mean?

Popcorn machines come in many shapes and sizes; not all are used to roast coffee. A simple "Google" of "Popcorn Machine" will lead you to believe I'm talking about a carnival food vendor.

Most popcorn machines used for coffee roasting fall into one of three categories:

- __Air Poppers__. Most common popcorn popper, found with a variety of brands.
- __Electric Heat Plate with a Motorized Stirring Rod__. Similar to the _Stir Crazy_.
- __Stove-Top Pan with Stirring Mechanism__. Similar to the _Whirley Pop_.

Not only are these coffee machines cheap, but they are also common; you may even own one already!
